# Facebook-clone
This is a simple Facebook clone built with html and bootstrap and javascript . The application mimics the core features of Facebook, including user authentication, news feed, posting content, liking posts, and a basic user profile page. It is designed to help demonstrate my skills in React and frontend web development.
